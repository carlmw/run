        <h2>Why am I running for Macmillan?</h2>

        <p>It has been nearly two years since my mum was diagnosed with cancer. Since then she has been through numerous surgeries and treatments. Despite the debilitating long term effects of these, she has faced them with a degree of determination and bravery that makes me feel so very proud of her.</p>

        <p>The NHS was there to treat her illness but beyond that there was nothing to help her cope with the psychological and practical issues - the hidden side of cancer and how it affects cancer patients and what they have to face on a daily basis.</p>

        <p>Thankfully a very caring Macmillan cancer nurse specialist recognised my mum needed support and started to put a care plan in place.</p>

        <p>My mum was put in touch with a Macmillan counsellor, support groups and help advice lines — all funded by Macmillan. This was the life line that helped support her through very challenging times. Only trained professionals in cancer could understand what she was going through, for this support I am immensely grateful.</p>

        <p>Mum has battled cancer and with this support and personal determination she has come through with a new perspective and drive.</p>

        <p>Through Macmillan funding she was able to attend a self-management programme called HOPE which enables cancer patients who have finished treatment to deal with the challenges of re-building their lives.</p>

        <p>Following this my mum has become a trained volunteer facilitator for Macmillan. She helps other cancer patients just finishing treatment with her understanding of what they are going through. Recently she has being asked to chair a cancer patient panel and is an active e-campaigner with Macmillan — lobbying parliament for continued improvements in cancer care.</p>

        <p>Again I am so very proud of her and hugely grateful to Macmillan for all the support they have given her. Running a couple of marathons to raise a little money to help them fund their essential work is a small thing that I can do. It's an opportunity to start to say thank you for being there for my mum.</p>

        <h2>What</h2>

        <p>I'll be running the <strong>Brighton Marathon</strong> on Sunday, April 9, 2017 then two weeks later I'll be running the <strong>London Marathon</strong> on Sunday 23 April 2017</p>

        <h3>Targets and stretch goals.</h3>

        <p><strong class="goal">£2000</strong> — I'm hoping we can at least raise this.</p>
        <p><strong class="goal">£2500</strong> — If we can raise this then I will run both races while wearing a pair of <a href="http://www.necomimi.com/">Necomimi Cat Ears</a> and look hilariously miserable while doing so.</p>
        <p>I'll think of more stretch goals should we need them.</p>
